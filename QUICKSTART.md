# Your Ethereum private key (starts with 0x)
HYPER_LIQUID_ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=0xyour-private-key-here

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Trading Settings (Optional)

Edit `agents/agent_configs.py`:

```python
CONFIG = {
    'STARTING_CAPITAL_USD': 500,         # Change to your capital
    'SYMBOLS': ['BTC', 'ETH'],           # Coins to trade
    'MAX_LEVERAGE': 20,                  # Lower for safer trading
    'CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES': 3,         # Check frequency
    'MIN_CONFIDENCE_TO_TRADE': 0.65,     # Higher = safer but fewer trades
}
```

**Recommended for beginners:**
- Start with $50-100 capital

- Increase confidence to 0.75
- Trade only BTC and ETH

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Checklist

Before running with real money:

- [ ] I have backed up my private keys securely
- [ ] I'm only using funds I can afford to lose
- [ ] I've tested with small amounts first ($10-50)
- [ ] I understand leverage increases both gains AND losses
- [ ] I've set appropriate stop loss percentages
- [ ] I'm monitoring the bot during the first few hours
- [ ] I've read the risk warnings in README.md

## üîß Common Issues

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas_ta'"
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "DEEPSEEK_KEY not found"
```bash
# Make sure .env file exists
ls -la .env

# Check contents (keys should not be empty)
cat .env
```

### "Can't connect to HyperLiquid"
- Verify your private key starts with `0x`
- Ensure wallet has some funds
- Check internet connection

### Bot keeps saying "DO_NOTHING"
- This is normal - AI is being cautious
- Lower `MIN_CONFIDENCE_TO_TRADE` to 0.60
- Market conditions might not be favorable
